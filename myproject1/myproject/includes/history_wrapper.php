                    <p>The founding of Heritage International School (HIS) was initiated by a group of mothers from a study group at a family picnic in the late 80s. HIS opened on the 9th of September 1994, and was sponsored by five different Christian missions: Baptist Mission Mission (BD). Common standards keeps us focused on learning appropriate content and preparing our students to graduate. </p>
